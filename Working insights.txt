Downloading a file from G-sheets is not big deal but its not that easy to webscrap it and download the same in a .xlsx or .doc format

<!-- I havent scrapped G-sheets as thats against some companies policies --!>
Ultimate goal is to download a copy of .xlsx thats is openable and not corrupted.

Here is python 'the saviour' for you..

Module 1 : Getting the file url
I got the edit link to the file (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/"this is your file key/id"/edit?usp=sharing) 
   there is a loophole we say or a benifit that 
   replacing "edit?usp=sharing" with "export?format=xlsx" will instantly download the file (excel in this case)
  
 so my module one of the project ends with fetching this url to the browser which will download the file for us in our downloads area.
 
 Note: The link should be in Anyone with the link mode (or) your mail should be in the only person added and your google account signed in at Microsoft edge 

Module 2 : "Moving file and changing file name" 

             ->Here we look for the file in Downloads folder with its name specified(you needs to know the file name and link).
             ->After finding we are moving the file into folder we want (I placed it in the same file I have my scripts)
             ->Now attach the timestamps (year-month-date hour-minute filename.xlsx)
             Result we can see the required file saved in the folder. 
            
Module 3 : "Automation ?" 
           
           Till this we taught computer to download a file Now we want the computer to do this by itself. 
           
           Thanks for Windows Task Scheduler (WTS)
           
           "Create .bat file" 
                    -> create a txt file 
                    -> "python installation path on your system" "you .py script's path"
                    -> save the file with .bat extension 
               
            Now go to WTS 
                    ->Create task in right pane
                    ->Give name for your task 
                    ->Go to action bar. click new. in program/script add the path of your .bat file 
                    ->Go to Triggers. click new. select daily and number of days (specify the time) 
                    -> click ok and you are all set
                    note:
                    If you are using in laptop kindly go through conditions tab where there are some checkbox based on charger connected/not 
                
                Note: For WTS to run your system should be in running state (not power off/sleep). Yet its not necessary it to be runing in background
